## Implementation

This example follows most recent practices described by Meteor Team in official guide.

It uses few additional packages:
- `reactive-dict` together with `tracker` - For managing state in templates in reactive manner
- `kadira:flow-router` - Very simple router for Meteor. It does routing for client-side apps and does not handle rendering itself.
- `zimme:active-route` - This package provide helpers for figuring out if some route or path is or isn't the currently active route.
How was the app created? Anything worth sharing about the process of creating the app? Any spec violations?
